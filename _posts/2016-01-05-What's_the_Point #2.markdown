#What’s the Point?

A blessed 2016 to all...let it be a Stand-Out year for us.

Many times we say that we should stand up for Christ...I say it, I sing it, I believe it.
So I think that many of us are standing...I’m now thinking that we should stand-out for Christ.
That is a little something many of our young people are having trouble with. Don’t get me wrong, many adult christians are facing the same challenge. 

Let us take a good look at our lives and as we do remember...

We are new creatures in Christ. <br> 			
We should behave what we believe. 	<br>		
We ought to line up our lives with the WORD. <br>
We are to be Christlike.

For though once your heart was full of darkness, 
now it is full of light from the Lord, 
and your behavior should show it!     
*Eph. 5:8(TLB)*

We need to stand out for CHRIST, let the world see The Christ in us.<br>
What do you think ? <br>
Are you up for the challenge?
