#What’s the Point?

Greetings all, I’ve been reading *Titus 2* and *verses 11-15* stand out Bold and Brave.
We don’t have to compromise our Faith in God or the Standards set for us in His Word. 

>
------------------------------------------------
teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,  
we should live soberly, righteously, and godly  
in the present age,  
*Titus 2:12*  
>
------------------------------------------------

1.	We are to deny ungodliness
2.	We are to deny worldly lust
3.	We are to live soberly
4.	We are to live righteously 
5.	We are to live Godly

We are to do all these things in this present world.
